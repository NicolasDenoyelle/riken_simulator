This is the git repository for RIKEN simulator designed to simulate
the binary code for Fujitsu A64FX, developed by Fujitsu for Japanese
national flagship supercomputer, "Fugaku". The RIKEN simulator is
based on gem5 general-purpose processor simulator. Our base code is
the branch by Arm research for SVE. While the branch is merged the main
of gem5, we are using the branch because the additional modifications
on the base code is still large. We tuned several parameters and
extended the functions to improve the accuracy for the A64FX
behavior. The details of extensions and the comparison with A64FX test
chip are described in [1, 2].

Most parameters in the RIKEN simulator are aligned to the parameters
described in the A64FX microarchitecture manual
(https://github.com/fujitsu/A64FX). However, the values of some parameters
could not be applied as they are due to differences in implementation,
and the values are set by appropriately evaluating them.
